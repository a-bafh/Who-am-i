# Who-am-i
the life and aspirations of William clayton
interest
  I am a medieval weapon enthusiast who fights with there friends twice a month
  I'm a terrible mathematician that hate math
  I believe I'm easy going
  I can be a bit moody if I'm waken before my alarm
  I used to bowl for a junior league and won two silver medals
  I took six years in a French school and because of that I can speak French semi-fluid
my career plan
  I plan to star my career in either fast food, or retail where I assume most kids start. I'll gun for manager or assistant-manager to gain as much experience as possible. I'll work during my time in the university of Alberta trying to get my degree in bio-medical engineering. Once I get my degree I'll start to work on a device that can rehabilitate people whilst they're in a coma.
