interest

  I am a medieval weapon enthusiast who fights with there friends twice a month

  I'm a terrible mathematician that hate math

  I believe I'm easy going

  I can be a bit moody if I'm waken before my alarm

  I used to bowl for a junior league and won two silver medals

  I took six years in a French school and because of that I can speak French semi-fluid

my career plan
  I plan to star my career in either fast food, or retail where I assume most kids start. I'll gun for (manager) or (assistant-manager) to gain as much experience as possible. I'll work during my time in the (university of Alberta) trying to get my degree in (bio-medical engineering). Once I get my degree I'll start to work on a device that can (rehabilitate people whilst they're in a coma).
