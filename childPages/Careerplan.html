   <h2>First plan</h2>
      <article>
        <p>My first career plan was made at the age of ten and it wasn't very good. Mostly because I made it when I was 10.
        It started with me finishing high school and getting a job at a fast food or retail store and slowly making money, eventually I'd make enough
        to get me through university. After uni I would try becoming a astrophysicist make a huge discovery and with a six figure sallary i'd retire and live
        a very confortable life the age of fifty. </p>

       <article>
         <p>this plan is a bit more realistic. I would get a any job I could at grade eleven and start to build up a finacial safty net incase of somthing happened.
            after that i would get as high as I could in that organations food chain and make enough money to get through uni with as little dept as possible   </p>
