   <h2>My medival fantasy</h2>

<article>
   <p>since I was a little kid I always loved the thought of fighting someone witha sword despite it having a lot of risk.
   one day my day came back from a vacation to mexico and brought back me and my brother a wooden sword to play with,
   and it was the greatest moment of my life I finally had a sword and I loved dearly. after that I started looking at random medival facts,
   how they ate, what was rude, how they dressed, everything eventually, I became so enveloped in medival knowledge I hooked my friends,
   we would pretend to be medeival royalty, knights, and sometimes peasants. we played and fought and hurt each other alot and well as we grew
   we slowly seperated but still every once and a while we'll get together and for old times sake have a sword fight.
   As a result of this I became more interested in the culture and am now more tame because of it.

     <h3>Bowling with the boys </h3>

       <article>
    <p> As a little kid I was a bit to interested in medival combat so to get my mind occupied with other thing my dad
        would get my and my brother to go bowling at first I hated it because I was terrible at it, I never beat my brother or and I could barelly beat
        the small todlers who came in. I hated it so much and almost never wanted to go the only part I enjoyed consistantly was when we would get food.
        I kept telling my dad I hated going but he was persistent and would tell me over and over that I would get better but I never belived him,
        I tried again and again maybe if I spin the ball like this or if I throw it like this, nothing worked. Until one day I did it, my brother lost.
        I was so overjoyed that knocked over my fries, I didnt care though. Over time I won again and agian eventually my brothers natural talent had disapeared.
        That year I won two silver medals one for my improvement and for the having one of the highest score. Ive stopped going regularly but I still go
        every once in a while </p>
