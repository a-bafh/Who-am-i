   <h2>My medival fantasy</h2>

   <p>since i was a little kid i always loved the thought of fighting someone witha sword despite it having a lot of risk.
   one day my day came back from a vacation to mexico and brought back me and my brother a wooden sword to play with,
   and it was the greatest moment of my life i finally had a sword and i loved dearly. after that i started looking at random medival facts,
   how they ate, what was rude, how they dressed, everything eventually, i became so enveloped in medival knowledge i hook my friends,
   we would pretend to be medeival royalty, knights, and sometimes peasants. we played and fought and hurt each other alot and well as we grew
   we slowly seperated but still every once and a while we'll get together and for old times sake have a sword fight.
